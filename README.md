### Dependencies
My rice currently uses:

 - hypridle (idle manager)
 - hyprlock (lock screen manager)
 - kitty (terminal)
 - nemo (file explorer)
 - wofi (app launcher)
 - swww (wallpaper manager)
 - sddm (login manager)
 - Wlogout (logout menu)

GTK themes used:

### Credits
The theme used in SDDM is heavily based on the themes made by Keyitdev/sddm-astronaut-theme (https://github.com/Keyitdev/sddm-astronaut-theme/).

Some of the widgets used in waybar are taken (or inspired) from Meowrch (https://github.com/meowrch/meowrch).
