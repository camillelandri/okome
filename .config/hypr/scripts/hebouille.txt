a sea cucumber ~
procrastinating.
trying really hard to not yawn...
in love with Sae <3
playing too much video games.
planning to take over Saturn... one day...
a bit weird ~
a good boy!
hard at work...
writing stupid sentences for this prompt.
thinking hard or hardly thinking...?
staring into the void ~
trying to remember what they were doing...
wasting time on stupid stuff. And they love it.
dopamine hunting ~
evaluating their life choices...
wondering what their superpower could be.
thinking about their next meal.
a creative genius mastermind. (sure.)
spending too much time on their new obsession...
